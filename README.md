From an early age, I've been passionate about pushing the limits of creativity and innovation. When I was seven, I created an abstract space shuttle that was displayed at an art exhibition by [Robert Kessler](https://www.robert-kessler.de/), who recognized my potential early on. This formative experience now drives my work as a founder of **Blibla** and creator of [**Captain**](https://blibla.com/captain), our open source AI platform.
