I began my artistic journey at age seven with an exhibited design that showcased my innovative spirit. Today, I apply that same creativity to web development, emphasizing the ethical application of AI. With a strong background in UX/UI, I aim to redefine user experiences, pushing the boundaries of technology with transparency and responsibility. As an international speaker, I share my enthusiasm for innovation, guiding others to see the potential of Technology in crafting unique digital landscapes. My past roles as a mentor, teacher and team lead reflect my commitment to mentorship and making a tangible impact in the tech community. Co-founding Blibla embodies my desire to venture into new territories, driven by a passion for exploration. When I'm not coding, I find balance and inspiration through sports and music, fueling my continuous journey towards innovation.
